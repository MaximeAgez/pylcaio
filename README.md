# pyLCAIO
An object class that can structure, manipulate, and facilitate the hybridization of lifecycle assessment (LCA) and environmentally  extended input-output (EEIO) matrices.

* Only works with Python
* Read in, combine, organize, manipulate and concatenate LCA foreground and background matrices
* Combine LCA system with EEIO matrices
* Automate hybridization and correction for double-counting
* Can currently only hybridize ecoinvent3.3/3.5 with exiobase2/3

Additional features will ultimately be implemented: 
* Improvement of the templates to add processes (foreground) to the resulting hybrid database
* Export options in ecospold format (i.e., should be readable by mainstream LCA software)
* A full fleet of unit/functional tests to help the user to modify the code safely

The software is still under development but is already operational.

# pyLCAIO
```pyLCAIO```  is a Python package to automatically hybridize the ecoinvent database with the exiobase database. Most
ecoinvent processes will be added inputs which are deemed having been truncated by the person that generated the process,
such as business trips, banking, insurance, advertisement, IT, etc.

# System requirements
Under 16GB of RAM you will most likely run into a MemoryError, making it impossible to run.
